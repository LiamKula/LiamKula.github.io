Currently I’m taking 212 and 314 together and after programming in C using vim, I cannot understate how important coding standards are. On the other hand the only gripe I have with IntelliJ utilizing ESLint is how annoying the errors are, let me explain. I like ESLint, and I appreciate what it does but to me personally it's very tedious and annoying to program with the current 314 ESLint setup standard. I always like the end result of what my code looks like when I finish, it looks very beautiful and efficient. I feel that it would be better to have a script that switches between standards so I can program then I can ESLint say that I did fifty different things wrong in my seven lines of code. I believe that some coding standards can help a person learn a programming language, depending on the person. I do believe that some people are totally fine with ESLint while programming, but I believe that it's too overstimulating visually. If I stuck to ESLint for a while, I probably would improve my programming style. So maybe I’m just stubborn about it. So I think I do agree that some coding standards can help an individual learn a programming language, for the better of their programming education.
