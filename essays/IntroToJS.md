So far, I’m really liking Javascript. There isn’t any language I have mastered yet, but javascript seems to be pretty easy so far. Honestly I’m glad I can just write “let” for my variables and not have to worry much about them later. One of the things I will say is I definitely learned a lot about javascript from this module. Between trying to finish the codecamp work and playing Pokemon Go with my girlfriend this weekend was definitely a challenge but I’m glad I finished it. From a software engineering perspective, I would say javascript is a good language, but if I was coming from a computer security standpoint I would have a lot of different arguments about that. As for athletic software engineering, I like it a lot. I try to make it like a game, and I usually fail pretty badly on the first attempt and then I do pretty well the 2nd time. I find the WODs very useful as practice makes perfect, and so far they haven’t been very difficult. I would say that the WODs are a lot more effective than just reading a book, it's a lot more interactive which makes it great. Yes, the WODs are stressful but I believe that's part of the fun. Without a doubt I think I will really enjoy the WODs this semester and I hope other professors could apply the same approach in their classes. I wonder if the WODS difficult will change much.
