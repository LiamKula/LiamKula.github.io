Through my journey of programming, I believe design patterns are very important. My first introduction into design patterns was from OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and how inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction are crucial concepts to OOP respectfully. Now what are design patterns, and why are they important? Design patterns can be creative, structural, and behavioral. Simply put, design patterns are a template or solution to a common problem in software development or design.

Design patterns are great for creating efficient, maintainable, and scalable code for whatever you're working on. Besides OOP, there are many different types of design patterns like a singleton and factory method patterns which are both types of creative design patterns. There also exists structural patterns like the adapter and decorator patterns and as for behavioral patterns there's an observer pattern and strategy pattern. My main experience with design patterns has been with OOP and OOP has been very useful. In conclusion, design patterns are important and have been very useful in my software development journey.
