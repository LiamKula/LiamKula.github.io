I was quite jealous of how easy it was for people to program in html and css, it seemed as for their prior education or hobbies led them to understand how to use those tools. I felt after recreating a website unsuccessfully that I learned a bit more about html, while I did I feel I have gotten a better appreciation and understanding for web design. I would absolutely say without a doubt that web development is not easy. I feel learning Bootstrap5 was useful, it made me understand things about HTML that I didn't understand before. I guess all you get after the investment of time and frustration is more progress for yourself. I would definitely be open to using a different framework another time because just raw HTML and CSS isnâ€™t going to cut it. Also I feel that creating websites could be fun, it's just that there is a learning curve as always.
