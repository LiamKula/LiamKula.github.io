<h2 id="introduction">What is Life Before Death:</h2>
Life Before Death is a first person puzzle mystery game where you play as John who abords a subway train heading somewhere, but he can't seem to remember. All he remembers is he was on the train with his daughter Vivian going somewhere. When playing as John you can interact with different objects in the enviornment and solve puzzles to find the answers your looking for.

<h2 id="introduction">Development of Twig:</h2>
Twig's Quest or Twig is a small indie game developed for MULT 3651 (Game Design) as part of a final project at HPU (Hawai'i Pacific University). The game was built in Unity for about a month and finished in May 2022. I developed this game with three other people, with my role being the programmer, choosing music, and cutscene direction. It was a lot of fun, and this project took a lot of work. For MULT 3651 before we worked on Twig, each student worked on three of their own projects throughout the class. This experience was extremely helpful when collaborating on Twig so we could make the game we wanted.  

Here is a link to a video trailer of the game: [Twig Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sulj7yxplEQ)
