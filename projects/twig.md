<h2 id="introduction">Development of Twig:</h2>
Twig's Quest or Twig is a small indie game developed for MULT 3651 (Game Design) as part of a final project at HPU (Hawai'i Pacific University). The game was built in Unity for about a month and finished in May 2022. I developed this game with three other people, with my role being the programmer, choosing music, and cutscene direction. It was a lot of fun, and this project took a lot of work. 

Here is a link to a video trailer of the game: [Twig Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sulj7yxplEQ)
