<h2 id="introduction">What is Twig?:</h2>
Twig is a third-person FPS action-adventure game where players explore a small island as Twig, a guardian striving to uncover and stop the source of pollution threatening the delicate ecosystem of his home.

<h2 id="introduction">Development of Twig:</h2>
Twig’s Quest is a small indie game developed as the final project for the MULT 3651 (Game Design) course at Hawai’i Pacific University. Built in Unity over the span of a month, the game was completed in May 2022.

Our team consisted of four members, and my role encompassed programming, music selection, and cutscene direction. This project was both challenging and rewarding, requiring significant effort and collaboration. Prior to developing Twig, each student created three individual projects during the course, which helped our team bring our shared vision for Twig to life.
